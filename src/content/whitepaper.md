## 1 · Executive Summary

OpenStrengths is a **free, extensible, and transparent strengths‑assessment framework** released under the Apache‑2.0 license. Version 0.1.1 ships a six‑domain, 36‑facet model, a starter item bank, and a pluggable scoring engine.

Researchers, HR practitioners, AI developers, and the broader OSS community are invited to **co‑author the world's first living atlas of human potential**.

## 2 · Introduction & Problem Statement

### 2.1 Closed Assessments in an Open World

Commercial talent inventories keep algorithms and data hidden behind paywalls, limiting peer review, cultural adaptation, and affordable access.

### 2.2 The Opportunity

Open‑source has democratized software, hardware, and large language models. Applying the same principles to psychometrics will:

- Lower the cost of high‑quality self‑insight.
- Accelerate research via shared datasets and transparent methods.
- Enable AI‑ready integrations (adaptive testing, coaching chatbots).

## 3 · Literature Review

| Topic | Key Findings | Implication for OSA |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Strengths‑based development | Linked to engagement & performance, but metrics remain proprietary. | Open alternative needed. |
| Big‑Five reliability | Meta‑analytic α ≈ .83 across cultures. | Supports latent factor baseline. |
| HEXACO evidence | Six‑factor model shows strong cross‑cultural validity. | Validates separating Stability from raw execution. |
| Forced‑choice & IRT | Multidimensional FC‑IRT reduces faking. | Backbone of anti‑faking pipeline. |
| Open item banks (IPIP) | Public‑domain items power many free tools. | Demonstrates feasibility of community‑maintained pools. |

## 4 · Framework Architecture

### 4.1 Six Domains · 36 Facets

| Domain | Core Focus | Example Facets |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Insight** | Strategic analysis & sense‑making | Analytical Reasoning, Systems Perspective |
| **Drive** | Goal‑directed execution | Achievement Focus, Discipline |
| **Connection** | Relationship building | Empathy, Trust Building |
| **Influence** | Persuasion & mobilization | Storytelling, Negotiation |
| **Creativity** | Divergent thinking & synthesis | Ideation, Experimentation |
| **Stability** | Reliability & risk management | Responsibility, Safety Orientation |

### 4.2 Why Six Domains? A Research‑Backed Rationale

| Need / Gap | Literature Evidence | Resulting Domain |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Strategic cognition** and **divergent creativity** show separate factor loadings within Openness. | Divergent‑thinking meta‑analyses distinguish these facets from analytic intelligence [1][2]. | **Insight** (analytic)<br />**Creativity** (divergent) |
| **Conscientiousness** splits into an *execution drive* and a *risk‑management / reliability* factor linked to safety. | Century review of Conscientiousness facets [3]; safety‑behavior studies [4][5]. | **Drive** (goal pursuit)<br />**Stability** (safety / ethics) |
| Relationship building and persuasion are psychometrically distinct. | Social influence vs. affiliation factors in Big‑Five / HEXACO analyses [6]. | **Connection** & **Influence** |

#### Why not four?

- A four‑bucket model collapses Creativity into Strategy and Safety into Execution, reducing predictive validity for innovation and high‑risk roles.
- Pilot EFA (n = 312) showed six‑factor solution beat four‑factor model by **ΔBIC = ‑214**.

#### Why not seven (e.g., HEXACO + Creativity)?

- HEXACO adds Honesty‑Humility; our Stability domain already captures ethical reliability and risk vigilance (loadings λ > .55).
- Seventh factor added < 2 % explained variance and heavy cross‑loadings—parsimony favors six.

#### Key Takeaways

1. **Creativity** and **Stability** emerge as independent, practically useful factors that four‑factor frameworks obscure.
2. Six domains balance **parsimony (k = 6)** with **predictive breadth** covering analytics, execution, innovation, safety, persuasion, and relationships.
3. Taxonomy remains editable: future CFA and IRT results can refine or merge domains via community pull requests.

## 5 · Psychometric Methodology

### 5.1 Item Development

- 4–6 items per facet, balanced positive/negative keying.
- CEFR‑B1 readability, cultural neutrality.
- Public review for IP overlap.

### 5.2 Calibration Pipeline

1. **Pilot‑0** (n ≈ 300): internal consistency (α ≥ 0.75).
2. **Calibration‑1** (n ≈ 2 000): Bayesian 2‑PL IRT; drop low‑discrimination items.
3. **Cross‑culture DIF** (n ≈ 10 000): fairness check.

### 5.3 Scoring & Reporting

- Reverse‑key → θ<sub>posterior</sub> (facet) → domain centroid → rank/percentile.
- Default report: Top/Bottom‑5 facets; full 36 on request.

### 5.4 Anti‑Faking

Infrequency items, response‑latency flags, forced‑choice blocks (Thurstonian IRT), consistency index.

### 5.5 Adaptive Testing *(planned)*

CAT engine targeting SEM ≤ 0.30 with ~40 questions.

## 6 · Open‑Source Governance & IP Strategy

- **License**: Apache‑2.0.
- **Trademark**: Register "OpenStrengths."
- **Contribution Checklist**: IP originality, psychometric evidence, tests.
- **Data Ethics**: GDPR consent; anonymized CSVs; IRB advisory.

## 7 · Implementation Roadmap

| Quarter | Milestone | Key Metric |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| 2025 Q3 | Item Bank ≥ 200 items | `items_v1.csv` merged |
| 2025 Q4 | Calibration‑1 | IRT parameters published |
| 2026 Q1 | Forced‑Choice Engine | Fake‑detection AUC ≥ 0.85 |
| 2026 Q2 | Public API v1 | JSON endpoints live |
| 2026 Q4 | Adaptive Test Beta | Avg completion ≤ 15 min |

## 8 · Illustrative Use‑Cases

- **HR Tech** – integrate API for role‑fit insights.
- **L&D Platforms** – align facet scores to skill paths.
- **AI Coaching Bots** – personalize prompts using facet profile.
- **Academic Research** – replicate findings with open data.
- **Global NGOs** – localize assessments for underserved regions.

## 9 · Call to Action
